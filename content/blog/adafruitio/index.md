Moving on to Day 2 of the \#DesktopPiChallenge - still impressed with the performance of the Raspberry Pi 4. Logging the CPU temperatures has so far showed things staying within specifications with no CPU throttling thus far. According to what I've read, the throttling starts to kick in at around 82 degrees Celcius.

Using my free account on [AdafruitIO](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox), it was fairly easy to get the temperature data up in the cloud and create a nice looking dashboard. I have published the Python code and brief instructions over on my [Github account](https://github.com/darrell24015/tempmon).
