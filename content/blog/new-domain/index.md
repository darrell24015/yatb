title: New Domain Name

I am really getting into this new [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) concept! So much that I launched a new domain just for hosting and displaying these projects. This [blog](http://yatb.devcali.co/), in fact, is now part of the **devcali.co** family of websites. I'm still using the amazing service provided by [Surge](https://surge.sh/) along with a custom domain name, no extra charge!


Things that I need to learn more about:

* The differences between using [unstructured data](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/using-gatsby-without-graphql/) and importing data with [GraphQL](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/querying-with-graphql/)
* Working with and optimizing [images with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/working-with-images/)
* Digging in deeper with [styling and CSS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/styling/) to modify and customize a site 
* Moving beyond just a starter site to working with [themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-02-26-getting-started-with-gatsby-themes/)


Yikes, that's quite a lot actually. Wish me luck! Thanks for visiting and come back again sometime.
