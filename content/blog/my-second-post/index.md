I love blogging so much already. Actually, I've been blogging in one
form or another since 1998. Wow, over 20 years!

Did you know that blog is just a shortened version of weblog? For me, blogging started out as a way
to keep track of interesting articles on programming and computer technology that I found along
the way. It very quickly turned into a huge phenomena!

Have you started your own blog?
